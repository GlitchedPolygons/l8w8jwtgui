# L8W8JWT GUI

l8w8jwt GUI is a graphical user interface wrapper around the open-source crypto library "l8w8jwt", which is written entirely in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) licensed, available on [github.com/GlitchedPolygons/l8w8jwt](https://github.com/GlitchedPolygons/l8w8jwt).

It's very handy for usage during development and/or for testing and implementing web services of any kind where auth tokens are involved. [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io) was used for implementing this GUI.

## Compatibility

l8w8jwt GUI is available for download [on the 'Releases' page](https://github.com/GlitchedPolygons/l8w8jwtgui/releases) for Windows, Linux (Ubuntu 20) and Mac on the x64 and Apple M1 architectures. More are potentially supported, but not officially tested.
